# NudeNet [**need to update document**]
Nudenet uses an ONNX model to detect NSFW content. This example is an application of [NudeNet](https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet)'s capabilities, which detects NSFW elements in images and applies a mask as a post-processing step. This technique demonstrates the use of nudenet to detect potentially inappropriate content in order to ensure the safety of minors on certain websites
